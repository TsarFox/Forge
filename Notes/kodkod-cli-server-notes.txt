racket server to interface with kodkod cli. Stolen from rosette v1.1

which source files do I need to steal?

kks.rkt, ofc.
likely common/server.rkt
we need our own version of cmd.rkt

can't read enc.rkt at all, so no on that one. doesn't look very modifiable for our needs anyway.
probably need our own version of env.rkt



Wait a sec, what am I doing? I just need a service to print stuff. I don't need to understand our own ast at all.
I just need to provide functions that map to the kodkod-cli ast.
so with that in mind, what do I need to provide?

kks.rkt, comm/server.rkt, kodkod.rkt, server.rkt

OK so there are no models or anything used before the prints to the server. That's all done by charlie, he just asks to print, I'm not building up a racket representation of the kodkod spec beforehand.

But I think I should provide a simple way to interpret the output. Yeah, that also falls under the server's responsibility. 

that's also in kks.rkt
