make visualizer look pretty!
consider projection options

The weird thing is that alloy projection combines projection over Node with projection over Node0

Try just projecting over Node0, for instance.

For now, do what Alloy does, and document it. Even though it sucks.
Generate a warning for projection when a type appears twice in tuples
Maybe make function editable by users?? yea!!!

Can I do integers without kodkod? don't need special integer atoms
cardinality constraints?
what else? always comes down to cardinality, or arithmetic on integers in sets
How can I make that work?

OK so say I put integers in a relation. I'm actually just putting 

Ach no it is complicated, because the model has to affect the model...
Like, what if I put in a requirement that two numbers sum to a third??
kodkod is better, yeah.


check out kodkodi, see whether we can adapt it.
We want cores
