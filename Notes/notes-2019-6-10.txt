next goals:

transitive closure / union on sets using functions
but also a repl, reasonable error messages
language levels
Looking for overconstraint? Did we ever see this sort of thing in a model, basically.



Probably never gonna gonna use cvc4. But could experiment with it! Not married to either z3 or cvc4

Could try modifying the z3 smt repl to include transitive closure     








We're gonna be using racket no matter what. Cuz Shriram has pull, cuz it's easy to extend, cuz we can pivot to ocelot, a dozen reasons.

Investigate furtehr how the rosette repl is working. Cuz then we don't have to do z3py bullshit.

Tim's gonna post on github about transitive closure repl



Pivot to trying to understand rosette repl, cuz that obviously works



essential questions: can transitive closure be used outside of z3 interface
whats up with push? why does it mess with transitive closure?                                                                                                                        





Modes for Forge:
Alloy: build model, get repl
Check expec: provide examples for their predicates
Diff: see differences between your models and the correct moels
Test: you provide the predicates for check expec
