monday the 15th: want mvp, hard deadline (error messages, reasonable visualizer, talk to tim about what mvp is) just expor json, don't rely on js, make it easily customizable

maybe allow better theming for higher arity relations, permute which values appear as labels
assign source, sink, edgelabels

maybe design these things around the alloy assignments for the course

special situations for weighted / stateful relations, basically arity 2 + a little something something

cytoscape is good!
