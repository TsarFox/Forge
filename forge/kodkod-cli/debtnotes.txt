How do I want to refactor?

well, exactly what functionality do we need from this?

we need a different kind of server mode.

well, not exactly. We still want to use the repl version.

but the parser/problem should be better adapted to this. How?
Well, we should have a different kind of problem, not complete or incremental,
maybe called stepper, where you can step through solutions.

and for a stepper, having the parser complete and getting EOI doesn't kill the problem.
It only kills the problem when you get EOI twice after a solve.
or (exit) EOI. yeah, I like that idea.


and I want to clean up the parser a tiny bit, cuz there are pieces that seem like bad ideas.

what else? I want the option of logging kodkod inputs, but that should be a racket thing.

better error messages would be fantastic. Could we do that with a parse tree?

and making sure that the syntax makes sense.



Also, add documentation!
