OK, so I need incremental models. How do I do that?
has to be through the cli ofc. So what's the command to get the next model?

Could be just solve, still. Yeah I prefer that. OK, and remember, input only really happens when you get EOI, right?
yep, that's how that works. OK, so it has to be (solve) followed by EOI.

OK this could actually be tricky because rn it closes the server right after it receives EOI. like, EOI always kills the server. But I have to change that!
yeah, check out read() in KodkodServer.

Ok, gross idea: the KodkodServer class stores the last KodkodIterator so it can just return those on future calls.


OK also remember I only need to worry about the serve call from command line stdin. cuz we're not using files for this.


OK! So each EOI just means a new call to serve(), but not a new KodkodServer, which is good, cuz now our models will carry over.




OK, and also, you can have multiple totally disjoint problems run through one parse, and it just prints the result of each problem separately.
but incremental problems are very different, cuz they build on each other.



Hmm, Serve seems buggy in the parser, also. Yeah, this thing needs some cleaning up. cuz Serve is guaranteed to succeed, every time, which seems fucked.

ahh, defs are not preserved with this strategy. that makes sense.



OK, next: make incrementality work from the racket end.


time to do cytoscape shit for the demo tomorrow.
